# Distros

For a long time I have been using to distribute the ISOs I create with penguins-eggs the [sourceforge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/), unfortunately for some time now it has been getting longer and longer to download the ISOs. 

For the purpose, for some respins: colibri and LastOSLinux, I created this download page using [mega services](https://mega.io/).

## Debian bookworm colibri
A light xfce4 for developers you can easily start to improve eggs installing colibri. Completely made from the penguins-eggs team and used for the complete development.

Download: 
* [egg-of_debian-bookworm-colibri_amd64_2024-06-30_1828.iso](https://mega.nz/folder/kTgnwCjI#eWwvhACs94fmGBakXCbG0g)
* [egg-of_debian-bookworm-colibri_i386_2024-06-30_1308.iso](https://mega.nz/file/cGwiTYJK#1op4xI_b2gdInkgg0mSNS-LPtINvh3mqmc3pYGUQzNI)

## LastOSLinux
After having for more than 20 years, countless success with Windows-based live distributions, team at [LastOS.org](https://home.lastos.org/) is teaming up with penguins-eggs to release their first version of LastOSLinux, naturally Windows compatible.

Their experience and skill ensure a very high level of compatibility and quality.

Penguins-eggs provides the tool for creating the system that is managed directly by [LastOS Team](https://home.lastos.org/contact.html).

Download: [LastOSLinux_amd64_2024-06-26_1620.iso](https://mega.nz/file/YTgiHLDB#4eGqVuPwRfpBEJ3znklYsOzlvAoDIPkoQmp_ZYZomrA).


## [sourceforge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/).
All others respins, packages, etc, can be found at our [sourceforge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/).
