For some time now, we have been missing a valid Linux remastering program.

I have used remastersys, systemback, refracta, uck, etc. over the years, but for some years there was a lack of a practical software suitable for the purpose of building remixes - personal or not - to be distributed to friends or to make specialized vertical versions. I'm thinking of the various specialized distros, musical and other.

Well, the time is now ripe and a new remastering system has arrived and is also mature and stable **penguins-eggs**.

penguins-eggs is a remastering tool, allows you to make your own version of Linux and is compatible with:

* Debian 10 (buster)
* Debian 11 (bullseye)
* Devuan beowulf
* Deepin 20
* Linux Mint 19.3 (tricia)
* Linux Mint 20.0 (ulyana)
* Ubunti 18.4 (bionic) LTS
* Ubuntu 20.4 (focal) LTS
* Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy)


## THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PENGUINS-EGGS

It is a tool that allows the installation of the livecd with the graphic installer calamares, which automatically takes care of the configuration. It is also possible to customize the appearance of the installer through themes.

Thanks to a small repository on the livecd, you can install the system even without internet connection.

It includes tools for cleaning the apt file and for the log files.

For Debian buster, Debian bullseye, Ubuntu focal there are remixes called naked on which no graphical interface is installed. Excellent as a boot point for your customization.

It works and you can find numerous examples of distros remastered with eggs directly on the penguins-eggs page of sourceforge.
It doesn't come from nothing, the first commit is in 2017, now three years ago.
