The **naked** version of a distro is a minimal (cli) installation, however, reproducible with eggs. 

You can create an iso of the installation and install it on a new machine. 

Since it is a cli version, of course you won't be able to use the graphical installer calamares, but you will have to opt for the installer cli included in eggs.

## What is this version for?

What does it do? 

In addition to the characteristics of a minimal cli installation, naked remixes are capable of reproduction. 

It is possible to create an iso of the installation and install it on a new machine. 

Since it is a cli version, of course you won't be able to use the graphical installer calamares, but you will have to opt for the installer cli included in eggs.

However, before reproducing it we can integrate it with the software we are interested in. 

And so, it's up to you: you can decide to have a light and modern remix with xfce on an i386 architecture. or you can prefer cinnamon or kde, gnome, etc.

You can also leave it without graphical interface and maybe include apache2, mysql and php to have an xampp server.

Whichever way is open, you will not have spurious libraries of previous installations and your system will always be able to reproduce and be reinstalled.
