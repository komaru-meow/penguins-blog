Some time ago I received this message about an eggs problem with plasma:

```
I have an error on calamares installer.
when i want to install the iso. during the partitioning automatically. it has the following error:

job set the label on partition /dev/sda1 to root partition table of partition /sda/sda1 does not support setting names. job ignored
```

The error is caused by Plasma settings → Removable Storage → Removable Devices → Uncheck On Login and On Attach
and solved problem, calamares installed the system fine.


The Prince of Persia also sent us a new splash screen
