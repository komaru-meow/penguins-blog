## Where do the themes reside

The themes are an addon of eggs. 

They are seen by eggs in ```/etc/penguins-eggs.d/addons`` even though they reside in different positions depending on the type of installation and architecture in use.

From this link, they are compiled and copied into the relevant directories. For calamares ```/etc/calamares/branding```.
You should not, therefore, directly change the branding of calamares in /etc/calamares, but create an addon in ```/etc/penguins-eggs.d/addons```.

# link /etc/penguins-eggs.d/addons

In this directory you can find the addons of eggs. At the moment:
* debian
* deblinux
* eggs
* ufficiozero

Inside these folders (vendors) there are the actual addons. 

For example:

```
ls /etc/penguins-eggs.d/addons/eggs
```

* dwagent 
* installer-choice  
* proxmox-ve  
* theme

## Themes 

Nowadays we only talk about themes, but the same goes for the other types of addons.

Let's assume that our vendor is the tico user. Let's create a folder ```~/tico``` in our home.

We copy the content of /etc/penguins-eggs.d/eggs/theme into this one.

```
cp /etc/penguins-eggs.d/eggs/theme/ ~/tico -R
```

At this point we have to create a symbolic link in /etc/penguins-eggs.d/ to use our new theme.

First let's see where the /etc/penguins-eggs/addons folder actually resides. 

To find out simply give the command:

```
ls /etc/penguins-eggs.d/addons -l
```

discovering that, with deb installation and amd64 architecture, this is a link to the folder:

__/usr/lib/penguins-eggs/addons__

So, at this point we can create a link to our theme project:

```
sudo ln -s ~/tico /usr/lib/penguins-eggs/addons/tico
```

Well, we have achieved our goal. 

__NB: Following the update of eggs we may lose the link, which will have to be rebuilt, but not our customization__.

## Change the theme

We can modify and keep in our home our theme project that will be seen by eggs as /etc/penguins-eggs.d/addons/tico.

Now we can start modifying the content of ```~/tico/theme```.

### The structure of the theme

In the theme folder there are three folders:

* applications
* artwork
* branding

In applications we simply find the link debian-install.desktop, in artwork the icon debian-install.png and in branding we find the template for squid. 

I don't write long on applications and artwork, those who do remastering will do very well. We will talk about branding instead.

In branding there are two text files and some images. 

* branding.desc 
* show.qml

branding.desc is just a placeholder, it will be built from scratch directly from eggs. 

show.qml, instead, is our presentation. 

the various images: ```welcome.png``` and ```slide1.png```, etc are the various figures that will scroll during the installation. 

You can change everything to your liking. 

__NB: For information, see the documentation of calamari__.

# Using our theme


To use our tico theme, we will simply have to specify the flag --theme vendor in produce.

```
sudo eggs produce -vf --theme tico
```
